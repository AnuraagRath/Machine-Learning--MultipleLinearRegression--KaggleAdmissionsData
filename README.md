## Kaggle Admissions Data to create a basic Machine Learning Multiple Linear regression model:
I have taken a Kaggle dataset to create a Predictive model to ascertain the likelihood of a Student getting an Admission. This dataset is inspired by the UCLA Graduate Dataset. The test scores and GPA are in the older format. 

## The dataset is owned by Mohan S Acharya.

"This dataset was built with the purpose of helping students in shortlisting universities with their profiles. The predicted output gives them a fair idea about their chances for a particular university."

## Dataset:
* GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
* TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
* University Rating ( out of 5 )
* Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )
* Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )
* Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )
* Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )

## Importing the Data:

## Performing Correlations between Variables to find the best fitting Variables/Parameters:

## Nextly we create X and y variables and the Train and Test set:

## Score (Model Accuracy):
The accuracy of the model is just 84%. This is a base model and we will try to improve the Model in Later Models.

## Finally after fitting and creating the predictive model I fit in my own data to predict the likelihood of me getting an Admission:
